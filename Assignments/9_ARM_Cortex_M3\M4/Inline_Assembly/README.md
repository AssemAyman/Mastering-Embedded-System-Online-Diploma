## _In this lab we get our hands on inline assembly and we are going to do the following:-_

**Task 1) We read the Control register and save the value in the C variable (VAL1) while the CPU is in Thread Mode.**

**Task 2) Read the IPSR register and save the value in the C variable (VAL2) while the CPU is in handler Mode.**
